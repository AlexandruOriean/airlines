# airlines

This package contains information about flights, and provides functionality for
uploading multiple years worth of data to a database server. To help understand 
what causes delays, it also includes a number of other useful datasets:

* `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
* `planes`: construction information about each plane
* `airports`: airport names and locations
* `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names
